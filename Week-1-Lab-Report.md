# CSE Lab Report
## Step 1 - Groups
 The beginning of the lab was a bit confusing with how the grouping was organized but was quickily able to get into my groups. After introducing ourselves to each other, we got into the lab. Before this lab, I have never had a Github account so it was new to me and I was confused about making a course specific account for CSE15L. 
 
 ## Step 2 - CSE15L Account - cs15lwi23arl
  I had more help from a group member in this step than other steps after this because this is my first time 
  in the website. Once I recent my password, I was able to log in through Visual Studio Code after putting 
  ssh cs15lwi23arl@ieng6.ucsd.edu. 
  
  ## Step 3 - Visual Studio Code
   I had successfully downloaded Visual Studio Code from another class.

   ## Step 4 - Romotely Connecting 
   Once I resetted my password, I was able to remote connect to a remote computer.

   ## Step 5 - Run Some Commands
   In Step 5, I was able to mess around with the commands I had seen in the lecture prevously. I have also
   looked into my notes for the most part to memorized what each command means. The code I used for my 
   example 
   was cd and said it is used to switch the currently working directory to the given path
   
   ## Step 6 - git, Github, and Github Pages
   This is one of the steps that took me awhile to get the hang of. I have seen Github before from classmates 
   in prevous classes but I have not created an account for myself. 
   
   ## Step 7 - Creating a Website with Github Pages
   In this part, I had created an account in Github and went through each step in the website building 
   process. I created a Repository named cse15l-lab-report which was made public. After getting the gist of 
   making the page, I created two files with the .md at the end. I also learned the .md extension stands for 
   "Markdown." I had created two files from the step by step which made it easy to follow along.
