# Final Lab Report
## Skill Demo
One of my favorite lab activities, if it did count as a lab activity, was the skill demo. 
During the practice of the skill demo, it helped me imprint the basic commands that 
I had struggled to grasp before. Commands such as 
1. cd
2. cd .. / cd ~
3. Ls
4. clone
just to name a few.
**Before Practicing for the Skill Demo**
When I first started, I was confused just like my classmates. The wording on EdStem was a 
bit worry because it seemed like a lot more than it actually was. I did have a bit of help 
from Chat GBT and a classmate of mine who helped me through each step by dropping hints. 

**Skill Demo Task**
The way you start the skill demo is by:
1. Logging into my shh 
2. Then cd into the skill demo server
3. Compile with **javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java**
4. Run **java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore FileServerTests** (I added the FileServerTests
5. then cd ~
6. This is an extra step but **ls** to make sure you are out of the skill demo server
7.
