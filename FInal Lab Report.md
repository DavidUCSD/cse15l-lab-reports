# Final Lab Report
## Skill Demo
One of my favorite lab activities, if it did count as a lab activity, was the skill demo. 
During the practice of the skill demo, it helped me imprint the basic commands that 
I had struggled to grasp before. Commands such as 

1. cd
2. cd .. / cd ~
3. Ls
4. clone

just to name a few.

**Before Practicing for the Skill Demo**
When I first started, I was confused just like my classmates. The wording on EdStem was a 
bit worry because it seemed like a lot more than it actually was. I did have a bit of help 
from Chat GBT and a classmate of mine who helped me through each step by dropping hints. 

**Skill Demo Task**
The way you start the skill demo is by:
1. Logging into my shh 
2. Then cd into the skill demo server
3. Compile with **javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java**
4. Run **java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore FileServerTests** (I added the FileServerTests
5. Then cd ~
6. This is an extra step but **ls** to make sure you are out of the skill demo server
7. Clone skill demo data
8. The cd
9. I then used the **find** command and typed find written_2/
10. Then I put find written_2 > fileFolder
11. Then used the **grep** command to find "Lucayans" : grep -l -r "Lucayans"
12. Bahamas- History.txt pops up 
13. Then cd .. which will brign you back to the main directory
14. then cd into the skill demo server
15. Compile Javac FileServer.java  Server.java
16. Cat FileServer.java
17. java FIleServer 9130 ~/skill-demo1-data/, this will print out the website local host. 
18. The website will then tell you to add to the URL
19. It will ask you about the Bahamas-History from earlier and also ask to find another country that has a certain amount of files
20. The country I picked was Italy.

The skill demo required me to use commands that I was unfamilar with and forced me to use them which showed me hwo it
is it used in a more or less real life situation, aka, the skill demo.
