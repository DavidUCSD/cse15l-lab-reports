# Lab Report 4

**Introduction**
  In this week's lab report, I had to reproduce the task from the competition on your own. For each numbered step starting  right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step.

**Step 1:**
  Login into the remote server through ssh was the first step. After that, we *cd lab7* in order to get into the file which brings us to **Step 2**

**Step 2:**
  github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7/ (a total of 10 ups were used  to get to the command) is up next. Doing so was able to clone your fork of the repository from your Github account.

**Step 3:** 
  Once the repository is cloned in the terminal, we run the test to find out if the test fail or not. As we can see from the screenshot, the test has failed. In order to have the code run successful, we have to edit the code which brings us to Step 4

  **Step 4**
    After typing of the code *nano ListExamples.java* and editting the code which was changing one of the indexs from *index1 += 1* into *index2 += 1*, I reran the code once again to get a success. Once the output of the code give you an **OK**, you go on to **Step 5**
