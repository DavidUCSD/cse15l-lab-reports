# Lab Report 4

**Introduction**
  In this week's lab report, I had to reproduce the task from the competition on your own. For each numbered step starting  right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step.

**Step 1:**
  Login into the remote server through ssh was the first step which would lead to **Step 2**.

**Step 2:**
  github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7/ (a total of 10 ups were used to get to the command) is up next. Doing so was able to clone your fork of the repository from your Github account. The reason for cloning that repository was because it came from my Github.

**Step 3:** 
  Once the repository is cloned in the terminal, we use the command *cd lab7* in order to get to the test (this took 9 ups to get to the cd lab7). Then we run the test to find out if the test fail or not. As we can see from the screenshot, the test has failed. (It took 8 ups to get to th command to compile then 7 ups to run the test) In order to have the code run successful, we have to edit the code which brings us to **Step 4**.

  **Step 4:**
    After typing of the code *nano ListExamples.java* and editting the code which was changing one of the indexs from *index1 += 1* into *index2 += 1*, I reran the code once again to get a success. Once the output of the code give you an **OK**, you go on to **Step 5**

  **Step 5:**
    The last step is going to be commit and push. We use the commands *git commit -m* and then *git push origin main*
