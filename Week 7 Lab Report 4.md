# Lab Report 4

## Introduction
  In this week's lab report, I had to reproduce the task from the competition on your own. For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step.

**Step 1**
  Login into the remote server through ssh was the first step.

**Step 2**
  <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <Enter> github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7/ (a total of 10 ups were used    to get to the command) was up next. Doing so was able to clone your fork of the repository from your Github account.
